/*
The goal of this feature is to make player events work as an integrator would
expect despite the presense of ads. For example, an integrator would expect
an `ended` event to happen once the content is ended. If an `ended` event is sent
as a result of a preroll ending, that is a bug. The `redispatch` method should recognize
such `ended` events and prefix them so they are sent as `adended`, and so on with
all other player events.
